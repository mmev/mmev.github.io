## A little bit more about me
----

You can find me [at work](https://www.cl.uni-heidelberg.de/~mujdricz/) :) at the Department of Computational Linguistics, University Heidelberg.

In my spare time, I go dancing:
* with the Hungarian folk dance group [√Åfonyahegy](https://www.facebook.com/afonyahegy/)
* leading the group of the [KUZ](https://www.kuz-heidelberg.de/html/content/tanzen.html) with my husband
* in the dance club [TSC Couronne](https://www.tsc-couronne.de/)

At weekends, I go into our garden for handweeding, or cutting fruit trees :)
